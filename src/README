Building:

Run 'make' from this dir to build all.

'make clean' cleans up for fresh rebuild.

The stuff build is the following:

pre/foo-pre           -  'site pre' tool.
bouncer/simple_entry  -  entry bouncer.
nukes/foo-nukes       -  'site nukes' tool.
who/spy               -  spy tool.

Look in the dirs for documentation/sample setups.
