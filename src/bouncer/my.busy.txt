Quote of the day: 

Q:      How many journalists does it take to screw in a lightbulb?
A:      Three.  One to report it as an inspired government program to bring
        light to the people, one to report it as a diabolical government plot
        to deprive the poor of darkness, and one to win a Pulitzer prize for
        reporting that Electric Company hired a lightbulb-assassin to break
        the bulb in the first place.
